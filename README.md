This challenge was accompanied with starter code that can be found using the following link:
[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)

## Description 

This weeks challenge puts your Node.js knowledge to test and allows the user to create a command-line application. This application generates a professional
README file with hopes that other developers can access and use via GitHub. This project introduces the Node framework and NPM installs. After installing NPM, 
the user will be promted to answer a series of questions in the terminal. The responses collected will then be used to generate a professtional README file. The output for 
data that is insertered in the command line will appear in the 'generatedReadme.md' file. This application also offers a license badge at the top of the README. Although creating 
an application in this way is completely different it is still rewarding. 

## Installation

This requires the installation of the node_module which allows access to the FS, Inquirer, and PATH dependancies which were used in this applications. To ensure the 
node_modules is installed correctly a folder titled 'node_module' will appear in the folder of the project. 

Please note a .gitignore was used for this project. 

## Usage

This project is intended to be used by other developers who are looking to quickly create a professional README for their projects.
